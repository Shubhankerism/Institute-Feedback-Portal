		<h1>ABOUT THE SYSTEM</h1>
	</div>
	<hr>
	<ul>
	<li>Our institute periodically conducts a process wherein the students are provided with feedback forms for their respective faculties. They are asked to rate the faculties on certain parameters.	
	<li>This helps in improving the teaching process in the institute. But the problem is that the process is inefficient and cumbersome. In addition to this, a lot of paper is wasted in the whole process.
	<li>Thus, we want to create a system that performs all of the above tasks in a more efficient way where the student has no time binding and has liberty to fill the form online in accordance to his/her convenience.
	<li>The system being developed can be used by the students of our institute to provide feedback about the performance of faculty members for their  respective semesters. 
	<li>Each student is provided with a roll number that can be used by them to access feedback portal through which they can rate faculties. There is also an admin that manages the feedback provided by the students.
	<li>This application is linked to a centralized database which maintains the average ratings of each faculty members as provided by the students. The administrator has controls over the entire database.
